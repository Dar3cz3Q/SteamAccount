The page will not work correctly on this URL:
https://dar3cz3q.github.io/SteamAccount/


In order for the page to function properly, a new folder called "secrets" should be created in the main directory and the "keys.php" file should be created in it. 
The contents of the "keys.php" file should be like this
<?
return ["STEAMWEB API KEY", "CAPTCHA KEY"];
>
